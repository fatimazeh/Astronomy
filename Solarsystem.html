            <p style="margin-top:50px;font-size:x-large;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;margin-bottom:10px;">On first glance, our solar system seems to be well understood. It includes a single star, planets, their moons, dwarf planets like Pluto and Ceres, and smaller bodies like asteroids, comets, and the outer solar system Kuiper Belt objects. Yet, scientists continue to discover fascinating new findings about our solar system, and Hubble has contributed to these discoveries. For example, researchers used Hubble to study the trajectory of an mysterious object called ‘Oumuamua as it passed through the inner solar system. They are confident that this body is from another star system and has traveled into our solar system from interstellar space.</p>
            <p  style="margin-top:10px;font-size:x-large;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;margin-bottom:10px;">
             By providing a detailed look at the planets, moons, rings, asteroids, comets, and other objects in our celestial backyard, Hubble is helping to answer age-old questions about how the solar system began, how planets formed, and how the Earth evolved.</p>

    The storm enshrouded the entire planet in dust for several months, changing the temperature of the Martian surface and atmosphere. Scientists watched the warmed atmosphere closely as NASA’s Mars Odyssey spacecraft made its approach to orbit the planet.<br><br>
    Hubble has also been monitoring activity in Jupiter's atmosphere for many years. Following up on these observations, the Juno mission probes deep inside those cloud layers to learn what makes those storms churn. <br><br>
    In July 2007, NASA launched its Dawn spacecraft on a four-year journey to the asteroid belt. To prepare for Dawn's first stop at Vesta, astronomers used Hubble  Does Ceres have a rocky inner core, an icy mantle, and a thin, dusty outer crust?

    In June 2014, Hubble discovered the next target for the New Horizons spacecraft — 2014 MU69. New Horizons flew by 2014 MU69 — the farthest and most primitive object solar system object ever explored by humankind — in the early hours of New Year's Day 2019. Thanks to Hubble, New Horizons was afforded the rare opportunity to visit an object discovered after the spacecraft launched.</p>

  <p style="margin:50px;font-size:medium">
    Since its launch in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has tracked many comets on their journeys through the inner solar system, and traced their orbits to their farthest reaches. These icy wanderers, remnants of the debris cloud that once encircled our newborn Sun, give astronomers clues to the formation and evolution of our solar system <br><br>
    Most comets spend their lives beyond the orbit of Neptune, where they were pushed by gravitational interactions with the newly formed giant planets during the early development of the solar system. Occasionally, gravitational interactions with one another result in the orbit of one of these objects being perturbed until it swings into the inner solar system. When a comet gets within the orbit of Mars, the Sun's light warms the comet's ices. The ices begin to evaporate directly into a gas, and the comet brightens. At that point, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe the comet, detecting changes in brightness, noting expulsion of gases, and analyzing its composition.
    <br><br>
    Scientists can learn much about the building blocks of our newborn solar system by studying the composition of comets, but they can also examine interactions between comets and other celestial bodies to glean clues about planet formation and composition. For example, Hubble observed Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter in 1994. A series of Hubble observations spanning the year after impact revealed some surprising results, including unexpectedly low amounts of water in Jupiter's atmosphere.
    <br><br>
    Hubble observed Comet ISON as it made its first voyage to the inner solar system, contributing its study of the comet's activity to a wealth of worldwide observations. Although the breakup of Comet ISON was too close to the Sun for Hubble to observe, the telescope has observed the disintegration of other comets, including Comet LINEAR (C/1999 S4) and Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3. Hubble created a striking image of Comet Siding Spring's flyby of Mars. Hubble continues to observe comets as they travel through our solar system, bearing witness to the eventual destruction of those that edge too close to the Sun.

    <div id="d12"data-aos="fade-right"><div id="d13"><p style="margin:50px;font-size:large">We think we know Pluto. It's the smallest ball in our old solar system models. It’s a chunk of ice, rock, and hydrocarbons that drifts 4.67 billion miles (7.5 billion km) from Earth at its orbit’s farthest point. It's the tiny former planet that stirred up controversy when it was reclassified as both a dwarf planet and a member of the collection of icy cosmic objects we call the Kuiper Belt.</p></div><div id="d14"data-aos="flip-right"></div></div>
    <div id="d15"data-aos="fade-right"><div id="d16"><p style="margin:50px;font-size:large;margin-top:10px;">Hubble observations of Pluto in 2005 revealed two never-before-seen moons: Nix and Hydra. Six years later, in 2011, Hubble's keen vision found another moon, designated Kerberos, while searching Pluto for rings. In 2012, Hubble discovered tiny Styx while looking for potential hazards for the New Horizons spacecraft.Charon, which was discovered in 1978 and first imaged by Hubble shortly after launch in 1990. With five moons now known in the Pluto system, scientists are intrigued that such a small planet can have such a complex collection of satellites.

    <div id="d18"data-aos="fade-right"><div id="d19"><p style="margin:50px;font-size:large;margin-top:5%;">These discoveries provides additional clues for unraveling how the Pluto system formed and evolved. The dwarf planet's entire moon system is believed to have formed by a collision between Pluto and another planet-sized body early in the history of the solar system. The smashup flung material into orbit around Pluto, which then coalesced into the family of satellites now seen.

  What has Astronomy taught us about storms in the solar system?</p>
  <div id="d22"><div id="d23"data-aos="fade-right"><p style="margin:30px;font-size:medium;">Many astronomical phenomena occur over millions of years. But since its launch in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has kept a watchful eye on events within our own solar system, which happen on the timescale of days, weeks, and years. The short-term phenomena Hubble has witnessed on other planets includes the weather — watching storms arise and dissipate across the faces of other worlds. Hubble’s ability to see ultraviolet, infrared, and visible light makes it the ideal meteorologist for the solar system, allowing it to probe below the cloud tops and investigate the massive storms on distant planets. 
  <br>Among these constantly shifting weather patterns are dust storms on Mars. In 2018, a spring dust storm erupted in the southern hemisphere and ballooned into a global event enshrouding the entire planet. Hubble’s Earth-orbit perspective allowed it to view the entirety of the global storm, while its long-term presence in space continues to allow it to monitor changes in Mars’s seasons over months and years.
  <br>On Neptune, Hubble has captured the most insightful images to date of a planet whose blustery weather bewilders scientists. Neptunian winds blow at an average of 900 miles per hour (1,450 kph), and huge storms — some the size of Earth itself — come and go with regularity. Hubble’s observations captured springtime on Neptune for the first time, tracking waves of massive storms — each one larger than the distance from Kansas to New York – with temperatures colder than -350 F (210 C).
