Hubble’s keen eye has revealed intricate details of the shapes, structures, and histories of galaxies — whether alone, as part of small groups, or within immense clusters. From supermassive black holes at galactic centers to giant bursts of star formation to titanic collisions between galaxies, these discoveries allow astronomers to probe the current properties of galaxies as well as examine how they formed and developed over time.

            <p style="margin:3%;font-size:large">Astronomers classify galaxies into three major categories: elliptical, spiral and irregular. These galaxies span a wide range of sizes, from dwarf galaxies containing as few as 100 million stars to giant galaxies with more than a trillion stars <br><br>Ellipticals, which account for about one-third of all galaxies, vary from nearly circular to very elongated. They possess comparatively little gas and dust, contain older stars and are not actively forming stars anymore. The largest and rarest of these, called giant ellipticals, are about 300,000 light-years across. Astronomers theorize that these are formed by the mergers of smaller galaxies. Much more common are dwarf ellipticals, which are only a few thousand light-years wide.
            <br><br>Spiral galaxies appear as flat, blue-white disks of stars, gas and dust with yellowish bulges in their centers. These galaxies are divided into two groups: normal spirals and barred spirals. In barred spirals, the bar of stars runs through the central bulge. The arms of barred spirals usually start at the end of the bar instead of from the bulge. Spirals are actively forming stars and comprise a large fraction of all the galaxies in the local<br><br>Irregular galaxies, which have very little dust, are neither disk-like nor elliptical. Astronomers often see irregular galaxies as they peer deeply into the universe, which is equivalent to looking back in time. These galaxies are abundant in the early universe, before spirals and ellipticals developed.

She was studying how galaxies spin when she realized the vast spiral Andromeda Galaxy seemed to be rotating strangely. In an apparent violation of Newton and Kepler’s Laws, the material at the galaxy’s edges was moving just as fast as the material near the center, even though most of the mass she could see was concentrated at the center. Some extra non-visible mass, dubbed dark matter, appeared to be holding the galaxy together. She soon discovered that a huge halo of dark matter was present in galaxy after galaxy that she<br><br>Nearly half a century later, scientists still don’t know what dark matter is. They do know, however, that dark matter comprises some 84 percent of the universe’s material. Its invisible and ubiquitous presence affects how stars move within galaxies, how galaxies tug on each other and how matter clumped together in the early universe.
       <br><br>Some of the best evidence for the existence of dark matter comes from galaxy cluster 1E 0657-556, also known as the Bullet Cluster. This cluster was formed after the collision of two large clusters of galaxies, the most energetic event known in the universe since the big bang.  Because the major components of the cluster pair — stars, gas and the apparent dark matter — behave differently during collision, scientists were able to study them separately. <br><br>The dark matter by definition does not interact electromagnetically (i.e., with light) – it’s dark! So during the collision, the dark matter clumps from the two clusters slide quietly past one another, just like the stars, leaving the hot gas (most of the normal matter) behind. The gravitational lensing stayed with the dark matter and not the gas. If hot gas was the most massive component in the clusters, such an effect would not be seen. Instead, the observations appear to be the first direct proof of dark matter.
