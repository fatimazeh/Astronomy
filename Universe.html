By allowing scientists to study the origins of the universe, the earliest galaxies and the mysterious, repulsive force known as dark energy, Hubble is helping to answer age-old questions such as Where did we come from? and How will the universe end?

It is the idea that the universe began as just a single point, then expanded and stretched to grow as large as it is right now—and it is still stretching!
                <br>About 13.8 billion years ago, the universe sprang into existence in an event known as the big bang. The early universe was incredibly hot — too hot for even atoms to exist — and extraordinarily dense. In fact, scientists think that at one point the entire observable universe would have been about the size of a soccer ball. As the universe expanded, it became vastly larger and dramatically cooler. Atoms formed, then molecules. Gravity drew the matter into greater and greater clumps, eventually bringing into existence the stars, planets and galaxies so familiar to us today.

Dark energy, meanwhile, is the name we give the mysterious influence driving the accelerated expansion of the universe.
                <br>In the late 1990s, astronomers found evidence that the expansion of the universe was not slowing down due to gravity as expected. Instead, the expansion speed was increasing. Something had to be powering this accelerating universe and, in part due to its unknown nature, this “something” was called dark energy.<br>
                Since dark energy works against gravity, more dark energy accelerates the universe's expansion and retards the formation of large-scale structure

                Deep space is the region of space beyond the dark side of our Moon, including Lagrange 2, or L2, (274,000 miles from Earth) and asteroids. The nearest asteroid to Earth is 3,100,000 miles away.<br>Telescopes are time machines. When we look out at space, we are looking back in time. The light arriving at our location from the farthest objects in the universe is light that left those objects billions of years ago. We see those objects not as they are today, but as they appeared long ago.
                <br>The resulting image — made from 841 orbits of telescope viewing time — contains approximately 10,000 galaxies, extending back in time to within a few hundred million years of the big bang. Hubble can see even farther back in time by using gravitational lensing to find more distant galaxies that formed even earlier in the universe, such as in the CLASH survey and Frontier Fields. With its powerful infrared vision, the James Webb Space Telescope will see even farther back in time.
