<h5>As Orion closes the gap between the moon and Earth ahead of its Pacific <br> Ocean splashdown on Sunday (Dec. 11), we're looking back at the epic <br> launch that got us here. 
<br><br>
    Tensions were high in the hours leading up to last month's Artemis 1 launch.<br> Spectators began gathering at NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and <br> across Florida's Space Coast early in the evening of Nov. 15 in anticipation <br> of the late-night launch attempt, and a few off-nominal occurrences during <br> countdown spurred some doubts about whether the rocket would get off the<br> ground at all. 
    <br><br>
    While NASA's new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket sat fueled on the launch<br> pad, ready to launch the Orion spacecraft to the moon, connection issues at a<br> ground tracking station and a leaky valve on the Mobile Launch Platform (MLP)<br> put a hold on the clock and began pushing the liftoff time into the night's <br>two-hour window. NASA officials addressed the latter by sending a "Red Crew"<br> to the launch pad to physically fix the malfunctioning valve, which made <br>tensions even higher. </h5>

<br><br>
<h5>Relief came as NASA announced the team's success and a forthcoming<br> T-0 time from mission managers, but the excitement was interrupted by<br> a hold called due to a faulty ethernet connection at a downrange ground<br> tracking station. The clock was stuck at T-10 minutes, and again uncertainty <br>grew around the possibility of launching.
    <br><br>
    During any night launch at KSC, there isn't any confusion about the launch <br> pad's location along the horizon in the distance behind the countdown clock. <br> Rockets stand bathed in a dozen of NASA's brightest spotlights, shining <br>upward to set the stage for one of humanity's greatest technological<br> accomplishments. SLS' massive size made it unmistakable in the nighttime <br> hours along Florida's coast.
